2. **Test commands thoroughly** with the `/test` command before deployment
3. **Monitor performance** regularly with `/ping detailed:true`
4. **Clean up unused commands** periodically to avoid clutter
5. **Use interactive components** to enhance user experience

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Interactive confirmations** for destructive operations

## üéØ New Task Submission Behavior

### Key Changes:
1. **Tasks disappear after submission**: Once you submit a task, it won't appear in `/tasks` anymore
2. **Submission tracking**: Use `/my-submissions` to track your submission status
3. **Moderator oversight**: Moderators can use `/tasks show-all:true` to see all tasks
4. **Better organization**: Clear separation between available tasks and submitted tasks

### User Experience:
- **Submit a task** ‚Üí It disappears from `/tasks`
- **Check status** ‚Üí Use `/my-submissions` to see progress
- **View available** ‚Üí `/tasks` shows only what you can still submit
- **Moderator view** ‚Üí `/tasks show-all:true` shows everything
